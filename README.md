Threddy ðŸ¦– started in 2017, mostly by accident. I tweeted a gif of a ceramic dinosaur and joked that he could be a mascot for our twitter group. I expected the joke to last one day, however it's been years and I'm still pretending to be a dinosaur on the internet.

I've created various Threddy-inspired items: gifs, comics, t-shirts, stickers, enamel pins, ceramic dinosaurs, hats. Basically anything you can put a dinosaur or raccoon on.

You can find Threddy in a few different places on the web:

* **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/threddyrex)** - main hangout.
* **[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/threddythetrex)** - t-shirts and other merch.
* **[Tenor](https://tenor.com/users/threddyrex)** - a selection of Threddy gifs.

And you can find more info about the project on the following pages:

* **[comics](comics.md)** - I created a comic starring Threddy and his raccoon friend Freddy.
* **[tweets](tweets.md)** - a list of Threddy tweets. Some describe the history of Threddy, others are just ones I like.

Thanks for stopping by. ðŸ˜Š
